# Middle Node

    You're given a Linked List with at least one node. Write a function
    that returns the middle node of the Linked List. If there are two middle
    nodes (i.e. an even length list), your function should return the second
    of these nodes.

    Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as
    a next node pointing to the next node in the list or to
    None / null if it's the tail of the list.

  Sample Input
linkedList = 2 - 7 - 3 - 5
  Sample Output
// The middle could be 7 or 3,
// we return the second middle node
